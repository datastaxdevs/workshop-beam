## LAB

#### ‚úÖ `1` - Create your DataStax Astra account

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Account creation tutorial is available in [awesome astra](https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-account/)


_click the image below or go to [https://astra.datastax./com](https://astra.datastax./com)_

</a>
<br/>


#### ‚úÖ `2` - Create an Astra Token

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Token creation tutorial is available in [awesome astra](https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-token/#c-procedure)

- `Locate `Settings` (#1) in the menu on the left, then `Token Management` (#2) 

- Select the role `Organization Administrator` before clicking `[Generate Token]`

![](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/cassandra-for-data-engineers/blob/main/images/setup-astra-2.png?raw=true)

The Token is in fact three separate strings: a `Client ID`, a `Client Secret` and the `token` proper. You will need some of these strings to access the database, depending on the type of access you plan. Although the Client ID, strictly speaking, is not a secret, you should regard this whole object as a secret and make sure not to share it inadvertently (e.g. committing it to a Git repository) as it grants access to your databases.

```json
{
  "ClientId": "ROkiiDZdvPOvHRSgoZtyAapp",
  "ClientSecret": "fakedfaked",
  "Token":"AstraCS:fake"
}
```

#### ‚úÖ `3` - Copy the token value in your clipboard

You can also leave the windo open to copy the value in a second.

#### ‚úÖ `4` - Open Gitpod

> 
> ‚ÜóÔ∏è _Right Click and select open as a new Tab..._
>
> [![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-beam)
> 


![](./img/gitpod.png)


#### ‚úÖ `5` - Set up the CLI with your token

_In gitpod, in a terminal window:_

- Login

```bash
astra login --token AstraCS:fake
```

- Validate your are setup

```bash
astra org
```

> **Output**
> ```
> gitpod /workspace/workshop-beam (main) $ astra org
> +----------------+-----------------------------------------+
> | Attribute      | Value                                   |
> +----------------+-----------------------------------------+
> | Name           | cedrick.lunven@datastax.com             |
> | id             | f9460f14-9879-4ebe-83f2-48d3f3dce13c    |
> +----------------+-----------------------------------------+
> ```


#### ‚úÖ `6` - Create a Database `demo` and a keyspace `samples_beam`

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è You can notice we enabled the Vector Search capability 

- Create db `workshop_beam` and wait for the DB to become active

```
astra db create workshop_beam -k beam --vector --if-not-exists
```

> üíª Output
> 
> ![](./img/astra-db-create.png)

- List databases

```
astra db list
```

> üíª Output
> 
> ![](./img/astra-db-list.png)

- Describe your db

```
astra db describe workshop_beam
```

> üíª Output
> 
> ![](./img/astra-db-describe.png)


#### ‚úÖ `7` - Setup env variables

- Create file with var

```bash
astra db create-dotenv workshop_beam 
```

- Show the file

```
cat .env
```


- Load env variables
```
set -a
source .env
set +a

env | grep ASTRA
```
