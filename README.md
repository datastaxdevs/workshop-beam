## LAB

#### ‚úÖ `1` - Create your DataStax Astra account

_click the image below or go to [https://astra.datastax./com](https://astra.datastax./com)_

<a href="https://astra.dev/3B7HcYo">
<img src="https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/img/astra/astra-signin-github-0.png" />
</a>
<br/>

> :info: Account creation tutorial is also available here [this guide](https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-account/)

#### ‚úÖ `2` - Create an Astra Token

> An astra token acts as your credentials, it holds the different permissions. The scope of a token is the whole organization (tenant) but permissions can be edited to limit usage to a single database.

To create a token, please follow [this guide](https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-token/#c-procedure)

- `Locate `Settings` (#1) in the menu on the left, then `Token Management` (#2) 

- Select the role `Organization Administrator` before clicking `[Generate Token]`

![](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/cassandra-for-data-engineers/blob/main/images/setup-astra-2.png?raw=true)

The Token is in fact three separate strings: a `Client ID`, a `Client Secret` and the `token` proper. You will need some of these strings to access the database, depending on the type of access you plan. Although the Client ID, strictly speaking, is not a secret, you should regard this whole object as a secret and make sure not to share it inadvertently (e.g. committing it to a Git repository) as it grants access to your databases.

```json
{
  "ClientId": "ROkiiDZdvPOvHRSgoZtyAapp",
  "ClientSecret": "fakedfaked",
  "Token":"AstraCS:fake"
}
```

Copy the token value in your clip board.

#### 3 - Open Gitpod

> 
> ‚ÜóÔ∏è _Right Click and select open as a new Tab..._
>
> [![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-beam)
> 


#### ‚úÖ `4` - Set up the CLI with your token

_In gitpod, in a terminal window:_

```
astra login --token AstraCS:fake
```

#### ‚úÖ `5` - Create a Database `demo` and a keyspace `samples_beam`

Notice we enabled the Vector Search capability 

```
astra db create demo -k samples_beam --vector --if-not-exists
```
